@article{ANDP:ANDP19273892002,
	abstract = {It will be shown that the familiar components of the terms of a molecule; the energy of electronic motion, of the nuclear
vibration and of the rotation, correspond systematically to the terms of a power series in the fourth root of the ratio of
electron mass to (average) nuclear mass. The treatment yields among other things an equation for the rotation, which
represents a generalization of the treatment of Kramers and Pauli (top with built-in fly-wheel). Furthermore, there
appears a justification of the considerations of Franck and Condon on the intensity of band lines. The relationships
are illustrated for the diatomic molecule.
